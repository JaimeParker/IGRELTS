\section{Study/Work}

\subsection{Do you work or are you a student?}
Student + Degree + School + Major(engineering)

I'm a post graduate student at SJTU currently.

Majoring in aircraft control and information engineering. 


\subsection{What subject are you studying?}
Aircraft control and information engineering.

mostly it's about control stuff, like control law's designing and modelling of an aircraft

\subsection{Why did you choose that subject?}
I liked it in my high School and I was interested in planes, aircraft, something stuff

So, I chose this subject as my bachelor's Major and kept learning it in my master's study



\subsection{What would you like to do in the future?}
to be a robotics engineer



\subsection{What are the most popular subjects in China?}
computer science

seems with higher salaries than other subjects you can remember

\subsection{Do you think it's important to choose a subject you like?}
after the bachelor's time span, I'd say it depends on what life stage we are in

during bachelor time, one can choose subjects that are more universal.

For engineering students, they are math, physics, electronics and computer science etc.
the base for further study.

While in post graduate period, interest is rather important because
one need the interest to support his determination on doing research




\subsection{Are you looking forward to working?}



\subsection{Do you like your subject? Why or Why not?}

\subsection{Do you prefer to study in the mornings or in the afternoons?}

\subsection{Is your subject interest to you?}

\subsection{Is there any kind of technology you can use in study?}
