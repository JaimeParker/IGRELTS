\section{People}
\subsection{Describe a person you know who is from a different culture}
Leo Messi;
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Who he/she is
        \item Where he/she is from
        \item How you knew him/her
        \item How you feel about this person
    \end{itemize}

For me that person should be Leo Messi. I think almost everybody knows him or ever heard about him.
He is a football player from Argentina, with the nationality of both Spain and Argentina.
I heard stories about him in my primary school, probably the year 2010.
At that time Messi was still young, but he was already famous in the football area;

Firstly I thought Messi was a selfish man who only dribble the ball by himself and never passes it to his teammates,
and know nothing about the teamwork. But now, actually since 2014, I have become a big fun of him.
2014 is the year when the Brazil world cup were held.
If you are familiar with that cup, you must remember that the final was between Germany and Argentina,
and unfortunately, Argentina lost that game with Mario Gotze scored at 114 minute.
It's really sad because Messi and his teammates had several good chances before that goal.
However, they didn't make it, I mean the chance didn't convert to a score.
Sadly that match was just a start, Argentina lost another American cup final in the last 2 years.
For Messi himself, Barcelona was turned over twice at the European Champions League.

I remember once during that time, Messi quitted the nation team because suffering from so many failures.
But finally he came back again and led Argentina team for the 2018 World cup, sadly lost again.

Looking at Messi's career, you will see with such talents and diligence of him, failure still could
be a common thing. I like his dribbling skills, which is really attractive, and I also like his humble personality.
But most of all, I like his behavior that a man can be defeated, but sooner or later he should stand up
then facing and overcoming those obstacles.
This give me the bravery to handle my daily failure, too.

\textit{1. How can we get to know people from different cultures better?}

first of all, respect; which means keep a humble profile and better know some of his or her culture.
Especially the taboo in that culture;

Second one is to express any idea directly; That is to be simple, meet anything confusing, be free to say that
I don't know then ask;

For more or detailed understanding, read books or watch news. Movies is also a good way.

\textit{2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of cultural diversity?}

Advantages include that, one can know different kinds of culture and that could be interesting;
different culture brings various custom, life style, these are the treasure of all human being.

Disadvantage might be, more possible conflict.
But that is not for certain. Different culture might take misunderstanding, and even account for fight and blood.
However, that can be avoided by peaceful communication.   

\textit{3. How can traditional culture and other cultures coexist?}

by finding similarity and ignore difference as much as possible.
focus on the similarity or the double-win staff.
