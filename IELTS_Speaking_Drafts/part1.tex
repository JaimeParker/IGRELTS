\subsection{Do you work or are you a steudent?}
Actually I’m a student who came to university just 2 years ago, 
and it’s really a coincidence that I just study in this university
, which is a quite familiar campus for me.
But as a matter of fact, I’m not far from the day I need to acquire for a job, 
maybe just two or three years or maybe much longer, 
it depends on whether I wanna get a PHD and by the way I really 
would like to do something else except studying in a school during my gap year. 
All in all, no matter what degree I get, I need to work, 
I mean, like, go to the job market and get a job I like as possible as I can.
